        Package that provides all mirrors for Manjaro Linux.
        
        - Free software: GPL license
        
        ## Features
        
        - A GUI for selecting mirror/protocol combinations used to generate a custom list.
        - Generate a new mirror list by using several options:
            - method      : rank or random.
            - country     : a single, a list or all.
            - fasttrack   : limited ranked list of `x` up-to-date mirrors.
            - geoip       : mirrors for country if available.
        - Information
            - get-branch  : get current branch from config
            - country-list: list of countries with mirrors
        - API
            - prefix      : prefix for files handled by pacman-mirrors.
            - set-branch  : set branch from supplied branch option to config
            - protocols:
                - set protocol limitation in config
                - remove protocol limitation from config

        - Added protocol option to api.
          * Possible to control protocols from CLI
        - `/var/lib/pacman-mirrors/mirrors.json` is causing confusion so it has been removed.

        - Improvement on `--interactive`: select mirrors by protocol.
